   | Key           | Value          |
   |---------------|----------------|
   | data-text-path | textPath1     |

2. **Create Text**:
   - Use the **Text Tool** to create your text element.
   - Enter the text you want to animate along the path.
   - Select the text element, go to the **Identity Inspector**, and add the following data attribute:

   | Key             | Value          |
